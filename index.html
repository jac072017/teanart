       <h3>What is tea? </h3>
    <p>A plant called Camellia sinensis produces the leaves and buds that are commonly known as tea.</p>
    <p>A hot drink made by infusing the dried, crushed leaves of the tea plant in boiling water.</p>
    <p>Tea originated in Southwest China, where it was used as a medicinal drink. It was popularized as a recreational drink during the Chinese Tang dynasty, and tea drinking spread to other East Asian countries.</p>
    <p>Black tea is the most popular variety, offers a hearty flavor and deep reddish color that results from an extensive fermentation process that includes exposing crushed tea leaves to the air for a set amount of time until they are fully oxidized and dried.</p>
    <p>Green tea makes up about 10% of world-tea production and is a milder brew with a mild taste. There is no oxidation during processing. The leaves are simply withered and then roasted or dried.</p>
    <p>White tea is the rarest type of tea, come from young tea leaves that are picked before the buds have fully opened. White tea leaves are simply steamed and dried, which keeps them closer to their natural state.</p>
